# weather-app
An international weather forecast site 

Designed using Figma. Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Uses the OpenWeatherMapAPI and GiphyAPI. From this project, I learned how to:
- Handle Promises, specifically through Async and Await calls
- Manipulate React Hooks on functional components
- Fetch and extract API data with JSON
- Play around with CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
